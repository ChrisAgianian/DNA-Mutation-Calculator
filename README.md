# DNA-Mutation-Calculator

This is Version 1 of the DNA Mutation Calculator.

This Calculator computes two particular mutations that can occur on a strand of DNA, namely Substitution and Deletion.

The mutations that it handles are: 
  1) Substitution - exchanges one base for another (i.e., a change in a single “chemical letter” such as switching an A to a G).
  2) Single Base Deletion - one base gets removed from the strand (i.e. ATGCATGCATGC after deletion at index 2 becomes A_GCATGCATGC).

The mutation operations are implemented using Javascript. The Web App is styled using CSS and the core is HTML.

This version only handles one strand at a time but can support multiple operations at once.

I'm planning on making another version of it that uses a database and File API to read multiple strands from text files.
